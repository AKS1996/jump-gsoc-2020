# Blog 2 - GSoC'20 - Differentiable Optimization problems

Hi all! This blog is one of a series marking my progress in [Differentiable Optimization Problems](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5232064888045568). 
You may enjoy reading [my first blog](http://www.imakshay.com/post/8). In this post, I will briefly describe the MOI layer we've created over [DiffOpt.jl](https://github.com/AKS1996/DiffOpt.jl)
and how we'be made it more robust by adding more tests - both testing interface usage and benchmarking against existing [QPTH](https://github.com/locuslab/qpth) and
[CVXPYLayers](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpylayers) projects.
