## Example comparision 


+ Refer [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12430) for the canonicalization example - ref pg 4,5
+ Compared canonical forms in `cvxpy` and that provided by `MOI`
+ Used `fix!` to emulate parameters
+ the conic returned by `MOI` is not exact but similiar to the one mentioned in the article
